  # Strictly speaking, the tests that check the UI
  # (have_content, etc.) should be separate from the tests
  # that check what we have in the DB since these are separate concerns
  # and we should only test one concern at a time.

  # However, we are currently driving everything through
  # feature tests and we want to keep this example simple.
